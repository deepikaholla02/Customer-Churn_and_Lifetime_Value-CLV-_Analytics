## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project combines Machine Learning (Python) and Business Intelligence (Power BI) to analyze customer churn behavior and predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

It delivers:

🔍 Churn Probability Prediction

💰 Future CLV Prediction

📊 Interactive Power BI Dashboards

🌐 Streamlit Web App for real-time prediction

The goal is to move from descriptive churn analysis to predictive revenue protection strategy.

## 🎯 **Business Objective**

Telecom companies face significant revenue loss due to customer churn.

This project helps answer:

Which customers are likely to churn?

How much future revenue is at risk?

Which high-value customers require immediate retention action?

What behavioral patterns drive churn?

## 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**
1️⃣ **Churn Prediction Model**

Type: Classification

Output: Churn Probability (0–1)

Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

2️⃣ **CLV Prediction Model**

Type: Regression

Output: Predicted Future Customer Lifetime Value

Evaluation: MAE, RMSE, R² Score

## 🌐 **Streamlit Web Application**

The Streamlit app (app.py) enables real-time predictions.
